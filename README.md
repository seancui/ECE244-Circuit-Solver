The code in this repository are my solutions to the circuit solver for the class ECE244 at the University of Toronto. This program was actually built up piece by piece over the course of 4 lab exercises however what I have uploaded is the final completed version.

The program allows the user place resistors in a network and it will solve for the voltages at all nodes, given that at least 1 node's voltage is provided.


Feel free to use this code as reference (and hopefully it helps), however I will ask that you DO NOT copy the code directly as that is flat out plagiarism. Have fun coding!

Cheers,

Sean
